# yunolex-2

Rewrote [this](https://github.com/ephing/yunolex) to be faster, more memory efficient, more readable, and with new features, while maintaining easy extensibility and integration.

To Do list:

* remake input spec to be toml-esque
* redesign parser to treat scopes as separate sets rather than a stack
* test/debug regex parser and error messages
* extend to other output languages besides c++
* add helpful arguments
